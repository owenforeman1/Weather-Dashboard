# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
This weather dashboard takes in whatever city or town you are in and gives you the current weather and the next five days. It displays temperature, humidity, wind speed and the date on each card. I wanted to test by abilities with sever side apis and I leanred a lot about them during this project. If you want to know the weather of somewhere you are travelling or just whats going on outside your house this does everything you need.
